Great, thanks for asking, how can I help you?
Sure, what part of town are you?
And did you have any dining preferences?
Got it. And what kind of food would you like to eat?
Lets see what we can do. One moment while I find a few options.
So the first that came to mind is Mikuni, Local Japanese chain serving sushi, small plates & hot entrees in a stylish space. Then there's Red Lobster, a Lively chain restaurant serving American seafood standards amid New England-themed decor.
Both are fairly priced at 10-20 dollars a meal.
Red lobster is a 4.0 while Mikuni is 4.3 stars.
Sure that's (916) 564-2114.
Of course, it was my pleasure. I hope you enjoy it.
Take care now, have a great day, bye.
